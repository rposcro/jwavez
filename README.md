# Modules
## jwavez-core
Defines core Z-Wave model, provides:
 * device class enumerations
 * command class structures 
 * controlled command class builders and frame payload constructors 
 * supported command class interpreters, parsers and handlers

## jwavez-serial
Serial communication module, integrates host PC with USB dongle hardware. 

## jwavez-net-tool
Command line tool to manage Z-Wave network nodes. Separate documentation with examples can be found here: [JWaveZ CLI Network Tool](https://github.com/rposcro/jwavez/wiki/JWaveZ-CLI-Network-Tool)

## jwavez-examples
Just snippets of code to show, test, and check how the code really works. It's doubtful to actively continue development here as the network tool module is taking precendence over it. Possibly to be removed in the future when it becomes too absorbing to keep it up to dated.
